Example configuration:

```shell
LOG_FILE="$HOME/.payner_custom.log"
REPORTS_DIR="$HOME/.custom_payner_reports"
TEMP_DIR="/tmp/custom_payner"
```

### Command-Line Options

you can pass command-line arguments to the tools for temporary configuration adjustments.

## Tool-Specific Configuration

- **Threads**: Number of concurrent threads

Example:

```bash
# Launch Batman with custom settings
python3 tools/batman.py --requests 500 --threads 20
```

### O'Azis - Network Scanner
