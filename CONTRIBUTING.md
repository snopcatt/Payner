## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- **`main`** - Stable release branch
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for new features
- **`feature/feature-name`** - Feature development branches
- **`hotfix/issue-description`** - Critical bug fixes

### Release Process

1. Features merged to `develop`
2. Testing and integration on `develop`
3. Release candidate created
4. Final testing and documentation
5. Merge to `main` and tag release
